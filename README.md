# Brain_Tumor_Detection-
We have used VGG-16 module to determine the number of dataset that have tumor.
We have used the augmented data to increase the number of datasets and these datasets were divided into three folders:Test,Train and Validation.
We have downloaded the best models and accessed one of them to compare our trained model with it to determine whether our model is fitting or not.
Original dataset can be taken from [ click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
